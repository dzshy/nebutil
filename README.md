Implementation of generic data structures and algorithms in C.

## Motivation

I want to solve LeetCode problems in C, but most open source libraries are bloated. So I try to hand-craft one.

## Implemented

- (Augmented) Red-black tree
    - Has ability to support interval tree, segment tree, etc.
- Priority queue
- CRC32
- Hash Table

## TODO

- Linked-list (stack/queue)
- Vector
- String
- Unicode string

## Build

```
make
```

## Run tests

```
make test
```

## Usage

See tests and header files.
